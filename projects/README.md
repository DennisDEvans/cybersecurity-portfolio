This folder will contain my cybersecurity projects, including hands-on labs, security audits, and exercises from my training.

## Planned Projects
- **Network Security Audit** – Analysis of a sample network structure and its vulnerabilities.  
- **Incident Handler’s Journal** – Documenting security incidents and response actions.  
- **SQL Filtering Exercise** – Using SQL queries to identify and filter security-relevant data.
