# Dennis Evans – Cybersecurity Portfolio  

## 👋 About Me  
I am a disciplined and mission-driven professional transitioning into cybersecurity, bringing over two decades of experience across military, financial, healthcare, and logistics environments. My strengths include analytical problem-solving, attention to detail, and calm performance under pressure—qualities forged during my service as a U.S. Air Force F-16 aircraft mechanic and U.S. Marine Corps warehouse clerk, and later refined through work in finance, healthcare, and business ownership.  

My values—integrity, vigilance, and accountability—guide me across every stage of my career. I believe cybersecurity is not only a technical discipline but also an ethical responsibility to safeguard the digital backbone of organizations and communities.  

I took advantage of the free ISC2 membership program to build a strong foundation in the field while self-studying on the road as a CDL driver. I completed all five ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) domains, and I am currently advancing through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
